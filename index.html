        Season 1 ~><br>
    </h11>
    <p1>
        Expelled student Mike Ross makes a living illegally
         taking the Law School Admission Test for others. He 
         decided to start doing this to pay for his grandmother's 
         care. In the Pilot episode of the show, Mike agrees to
         deliver a case of marijuana for his best friend Trevor,
         a drug dealer, for a large payout. Mike astutely avoids 
         being arrested in a sting, only to stumble into a job interview
         with Harvey Specter, called the best closer 
         in the city. Mike's tenacity and knowledge of the
         law impresses Harvey enough to win him the associate 
         position, even though Mike did not attend Harvard, a 
         usual prerequisite, and lacks credentials to legally 
         practice law. Together they try cases for the firm Pearson
          Hardman while maintaining the secret that Mike is a fraud.<br><br>

        Season 2 ~><br>
    </h12>
    <p2>
        Jessica Pearson, the managing partner, learns Mike's secret,
        but other issues take precedence when co-founding partner 
        Daniel Hardman returns to the firm, pressuring Jessica and 
        Harvey. Tensions rise between the Jessica and Harvey duo 
        against Louis Litt as he takes Daniel Hardman's side to be 
        named senior partner. Mike begins to foster a relationship 
        with paralegal Rachel Zane but finds himself pursuing other 
        romantic entanglements after his grandmother's sudden death. 
        Harvey and his secretary Donna face accusations of burying 
        evidence and must discover the truth while keeping 
        incriminating evidence from Hardman, who would use it to 
        leverage a managing partner position. The intensifying threat 
        from Hardman forces Jessica into a merger with a British firm 
        headed by Edward Darby. Mike tells Rachel he is a fraud.<br /> <br>
    </p2>

        Season 3 ~> <br>
    </h13>
    <p3>
        
        Darby's presence in the firm gives Harvey leverage to seek a 
        position as a named partner. Meanwhile, the merger causes 
        senior partner Louis Litt to clash with his British counterpart. 
        Darby International client Ava Hessington draws Harvey into a 
        lengthy trial against his former mentor, and the lawsuit turns 
        into a murder charge. Realizing that his fraud can't continue 
        forever, Mike leaves newly renamed Pearson Specter to take a 
        position as an investment banker. <br /><br>

        Season 4 ~> <br>
    </h14>
    <p4>
        Mike's new job puts him and Harvey on opposite sides of a takeover 
        battle, causing the SEC to accuse them of collusion. When Mike 
        is fired, Louis goes to extreme lengths to persuade Mike to 
        come back to Pearson Specter, rather than working for shady 
        billionaire investor Charles Forstman. Louis demands a name 
        partner position, competing with Harvey, but his wrongdoings 
        get him fired instead. When he realizes Mike never went to 
        Harvard, he blackmails Jessica into rehiring him with the 
        promotion he desired. Mike proposes to Rachel; Donna leaves 
        Harvey to work for Louis. <br /><br>

    <p5>
        Harvey struggles with losing Donna and begins to open up to 
        a therapist about his broken relationship with his mother. 
        Louis' insecurity, however, and desire to undermine Harvey 
        create an opening for Jack Soloff, an ambitious partner who is 
        being manipulated by Hardman. Rachel's wedding plans and her 
        relationship with her parents are both overshadowed by Mike's 
        secret. Mike and Harvey both resign to protect their future, 
        but Mike is abruptly arrested for fraud. More and more people 
        involved realize the allegations are true, and facing a 
        tenacious prosecutor Anita Gibbs, Mike accepts a plea bargain, 
        pleads guilty, and turns himself in so that no one else will 
        go to jail. At the wedding, Mike tells Rachel that he will not 
        marry her now but if she still wants him in two years then he 
        will marry her after getting out of prison. Harvey escorts him 
        to prison making their last few goodbyes. <br /><br>

        A two-year prison sentence puts Mike at the mercy of Frank 
        Gallo, an inmate with a grudge against Harvey. At Pearson 
        Specter Litt, few employees remain to help. Rachel works an 
        Innocence Project case for her law professor; Jessica assists 
        pro bono but is distracted from matters at the firm and chooses 
        to leave her position to pursue her own life. Mike's cellmate 
        proves pivotal in a deal for Mike's freedom. He struggles with 
        his fraud being public knowledge but obtains a job at a legal 
        clinic. Harvey helps both Rachel and Mike pass the Bar and 
        persuades Mike to come back to the firm. <br /><br>

        Everyone at the firm struggles to adjust to a new normal 
        without Jessica. Donna takes a position as COO, and 
        Harvey's friend Alex joins the team. Harvey begins dating 
        his former therapist, Paula; Louis sees a therapist of his 
        own, with mixed results. Rachel begins her career as an 
        attorney, having passed the Bar. Mike continues to work pro 
        bono cases at the clinic, with Harvey's blessing, but one of 
        the cases puts Alex, Harvey, and others at risk. Louis and 
        Sheila reconnect; as does Jessica with her family in Chicago. 
        Mike and Rachel accept a job offer in Seattle to run their 
        own firm that takes on class-action suits and get married 
        before leaving. As the season closes, a case that puts Specter 
        Litt in danger is found to be the work of Robert Zane's 
        partners, Rand and Kaldor. When Zane finds out, he joins 
        forces with Specter Litt. <br /><br>

        As Mike and Rachel leave after getting married, Robert Zane 
        is now the managing partner of Zane Specter Litt, with Donna 
        remaining in her COO role. Robert hires a new senior partner, 
        his right hand and fixer Samantha Wheeler. Wheeler later 
        becomes a name partner alongside Alex Williams. Louis learns 
        that Sheila is pregnant. Katrina Bennett makes senior partner 
        and struggles with romantic feelings for her married personal 
        associate. Donna and Harvey finally admit their feelings for 
        one another as Season 8 ends, but Donna's mishandling of 
        client/boyfriend Thomas Kessler forces Zane to sacrifice his 
        legal career for the good of the firm. <br /><br>

    </h19>
    <p9>
        With Robert now disbarred, Faye Richardson, a special 
        master from the bar is sent to oversee the firm due to the 
        perception of the underhanded tactics they have been involved 
        with for years. Faye is out to dismantle and destroy the firm 
        but has a few skeletons of her own that can be used to take 
        her down. At the end of the season, Louis marries Sheila and 
        Sheila gives birth to their baby and Harvey marries Donna and 
        they move with Mike and Rachel to Seattle. Louis names Katrina 
        as name partner and remains to lead the firm, now known as 
        Litt Wheeler Williams Bennett.
